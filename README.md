# This is my test of pycharm git features

## List of keyboard shortcuts

* to do 
  * figure out a quick set of commands I should use
  * for example
    * add, commit, push
    * show log, diff
  * though having a little bit of clicking is not the end of the world
  * on the other hand, I want to try to avoid a ton of commits, but I also don't want to lose data in HD diesI
    * I have an idea
      * I will explore usign a topic branch (whcih is always good) 
      * then do rebase and squashing all of my commmits to make me look smart
        * need to research this
    * maybe I can create cron job to create autoamted back ups to the cloud???


* fetch
  * ??? there may not be key binding????
* Update project
  * TODO: research what this really means
    * I may get window to pick merge versus rebase???
  * command + T

* diff
  * usually not shortcut
  * command + D
    * but only works in Git tab


* add file
  * option + command + A
* commit
  * command + K
    * but I need to make sure I am not in "terminal" window, since I used this shortcut to clear CLI!
* push  
  * shift + command + K

* commit & push 
  * option + command + K
    * may only work after I have already ran commit (command + k) 


* jump to git tab/console
  * command + 9
* jump to terminal tab
  * option + F12
