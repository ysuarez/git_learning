# This is my test of pycharm git features

## List of keyboard shortcuts

* to do 
  * figure out a quick set of commands I should use
  * for example
    * add, commit, push
    * show log, diff
  * though having a little of clicking is not the end of the world
  * on the other hand, I want to try to avoid a ton of commits, but I also don't want to lose data in HD diesI
    * I have an idea
      * I will explore using a topic branch (which is always good) 
      * then do rebase and squashing all of my commits to make me look smart
        * need to research this
    * maybe I can create cron job to create automated back-ups to the cloud???

* fetch
  * ??? there may not be key binding????
* Update project
  * command + T
  * I get window to pick merge into current branch
    * or rebase the current branch on top of incoming changes
    * also a choice to pick one of them as default
      * for now, I rather always pick


* diff
  * usually not shortcut
  * command + D
    * but only works in Git tab


* add file
  * option + command + A
* commit
  * command + K
    * I can skip "add" and got straight to commit with this command! 
    * but I need to make sure I am not in "terminal" window, since I used this shortcut to clear CLI!
* push  
  * shift + command + K

* commit & push 
  * option + command + K
    * only works after I have already run commit (command + k) 


* jump to git tab/console
  * command + 9
* jump to terminal tab
  * option + F12


* extra shortcuts
  * copy commit has from log view
    * command + shift + option + c
