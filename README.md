# This is my test of pycharm git features

## List of keyboard shortcuts

* to do 
  * figure out a quick set of commands I should use
  * for example
    * add, commit, push
    * show log, diff
  * though having a little of clicking is not the end of the world
  * on the other hand, I want to try to avoid a ton of commits, but I also don't want to lose data in HD diesI
    * I have an idea
      * I will explore using a topic branch (which is always good) 
      * then do rebase and squashing all of my commits to make me look smart
        * need to research this
    * maybe I can create cron job to create automated back-ups to the cloud???

* fetch
  * there are no key bindings for fetch!!!
* Update project
  * command + T
  * I get window to pick merge into current branch
    * or rebase the current branch on top of incoming changes
    * also a choice to pick one of them as default
      * for now, I rather always pick


* diff
  * command + D
    * but only works in Git tab, or you'll get other behavior


* add file
  * option + command + A
  * I can skip "add" by going straight to commit, but it "adds" all changes to tracked files, and not just the current file. Which is what I normally do.

* commit
  * command + K
    * I can skip "add" and got straight to commit with this command! 
    * but I need to make sure I am not in "terminal" window, since I used this shortcut to clear CLI!
  * commit & push 
    * option + command + K
      * only works after I have already run commit (command + k) 

* push  
  * shift + command + K
  * From here I can do "force push"

  

* jump to git tab/console
  * command + 9
* jump to terminal tab
  * option + F12

#### Rebase

* I found how to do interactive rebase to squash/fixup, reword, etc commits 
* there is no key command to start rebase, though while in interative rebase window...
  * set commit to "fixup" (instead of squash)
      * option + F



* extra shortcuts
  * copy commit has from log view
    * command + shift + option + c
